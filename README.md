**Feature Detection and Matching**
This project demonstrates feature detection and matching using the SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) algorithm. It identifies keypoints in images and matches them to determine similarities.

**Features**
Keypoint detection using SIFT.
Feature matching between images.
Visual representation of keypoints and matches.

**Prerequisites**
Python
OpenCV
Jupyter Notebook

**Usage**
Clone the repository.
Code is present in S20220010184_FDDM.
Output images are in S20220010184_FDDM_output1 and S20220010184_FDDM_output2.
Add the sample images to the images directory.
Run the feature matching script(S20220010184_FDDM).

**Results**
The output displays keypoints and matched features, showcasing similarities between images.
